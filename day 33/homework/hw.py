#  Classwork 4: List Manipulation and Aggregation



#  1. Create a list named temperatures that contains the following values representing daily temperatures: [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
print(temperatures)


# 2. Calculate and print the highest temperature using the max() function
temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
highest_temperature = max(temperatures)
print(highest_temperature)

# 3. Calculate and print the lowest temperature using the min() function
temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
highest_temperature = min(temperatures)
print(highest_temperature)


# 4. Calculate and print the average temperature using the sum() function divided by the length of the list
# temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
average_temperature = sum(temperatures)
print(average_temperature)


# 5. Use a list comprehension to create a new list named above_70 that contains only the temperatures above 70 degr
temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
above_70 = [temp for temp in temperatures if temp > 70]
print(above_70)

 #6. Print the above_70 list
temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
above_70 = [temp for temp in temperatures if temp > 70]
print(above_70)
